Battle out in the outdoors of rocroi , the 30 years war just started , youre in command of the spanish tercio viejo of cartagena , pike and shot just will keep you alive , its time to re-write history and win this war that will change the curse of the world .. forever..

# About the mod..

Rocroi battle is a pve mod , that introduces pike and shot strategy into a real viable thing in the game . Your role its to defend your place and wait until the enemy regiments are left over with just the posibility of defending the besiege of the city . 

You will start with a regiment of the tercio viejo , the first try of the french to take your basement will be in vain , or at least it should . It depends to you on how you manage to survive the first regiment .

If you win , your units will automatically come back to their spot and you will be rewarded with some reinforcements , here is when the math comes with an importance , because the number of reinforcements its not re-ajusted depending on your current alive troops . So you cannot waste ANY of the potential you have with your current units.

If you loose , you will fail to recieve the reinforcements and you will simply loose the game . 

You will notice that the change of difficulty its actually linear and with each wave you win , it gets harder and the AI tries new strategies , wave 5 its the most serious one , and in this one you will surely have to use pike and shot strat to survive . After wave 6 and 7 will also become a challenge and you may not survive in your first attempts .

The battle Of Rocroi Mod takes usually 20 or 30 minutes to complete , but if you use some **tricks** , maybe you can round that number to 10 minutes or so. 

As a spaniard on my own i want to say that im not against france or nothing like that , i did actually made this mod in memorial of our ancestors. The objective is to beat french , but only because french have already won the war . If spain originally won the war , the objective would change to defeat the spanish . So dont feel attacked. 

# About history ..

The battle of Rocroi was a real thing , where real people died on it . The battle of rocroi started on 1643 , the 30 years war just started and france was informed that two tercios were commanded to destroy and conquer Rocroi . In command of the spaish tercios we had Francisco de Melo and in the french regiment we had Luis II de Borbón-Condé , properly known as the Duque of Enghien . 

Spain originally lost this war , and this was known as the point when spain started to loose its empire and its hegemony on europe.

France did win this war , according to wikipedia they did win because they were informed that spanish reinforcements were coming , so they did a surprise attack. 

The first two cavalry attacks were horrible for france , and enghien barely survived . But then they saw a posibility and they desintegrated the arcabuceros formation leading to a catastrophic tercio dissolvement . After seeing this loss , the italian and german tercios surrendered and only spanish tercios were left on the battle , they resisted 3 more cavalry attacks and then they won a push of pike (pikeman vs pikeman battle) 

After all , they lost due to the loss of reinforcements and because spanish cannons were out of munition , as well as one of the regiments of the tercio of arcabuces was dissolved.

They were actually offered an honored surrender . But spanish tercios did reply with "his execellency seems to forget that he is facing an spanish tercio" .

# About setting the mod . 

For this mod i actually did spend a lot of time trying to minimize what the player has to do manually and i think i did finally ended up in a sweet spot . The only thing you will need to change after selecting the "Rocroi 1V battle" map is to set the player start ubications from random to manual in the map settings and you will need to change your player spawn position to spot number 1 .

After that you are ready to play .

No need to set up teams , no need to change player resources , no need to change fog , no need to change gamemode etc.. , this is all done via script and already adjusted for your experience , it doesnt matter if you chage your fog setting to concealed , it will apeear as revealed for all players after the match starts .

You cannot hack player resources either , its already adjusted so player resources will set to 0 after cinematic ends .

Your only job is to set player spawn positions and youre ready to go!

# About cinematics!

As i said before , rocroi has cinematics , it will start after you press the "ready" button after setting up my map , you will probably going to see a cool introductory battle to explain things up and an example of pike and shot at the end of the cinematic , after the cinematic ends , youre ready to play!

**CINEMATIC BUGS**

Im still investigating on this issue ,it seems you cannot skip the cinematic , if you skip it , the mod will crash for some reason . I will investigate more on this problem ..

Cinematic ending does not work for now but it surely will be in the final version of rocroi , in 30th this month.

**CINEMATIC CREDITS**

Thanks to seabass , wich actually did put a lot of effort into explaining me on how to do cinematics , i asked him if we could do these campaigns cinematics and he replied "yes" , their team even put the effort into making an actual guide about swoopy cameras . So thank you , relic for the help. 

# About regiments 

Rocroi mod works with regiments , internally i call them "waves" , instead of regiments . Rocroi mod basically uses unit wave movement , spawns an sgroup of units , and sends them into an scar marker (A location internally set up in the map) , so if i want to the enemy regiment / wave to attack your current alive troops , i just need to do an attack move of the enemy units , obviously programmed internally to do it. These enemy regiments attack move an scar marker , your units should be in THAT scar marker in the moment of the attack , so to purposely make that your units are in the scar marker that i want , after you complete each wave your units are ordened to move into that scar marker , and if you purposely try to scape enemy units you will have no choice but to fight them , otherwise you wont complete the objective and you will never win . 

Wave 1 : Its just an introduction to the battle , a cavalry push basically , you will need to attack move when the enemy cavalry is close to you , other wise you may loose some troops and it will simply be a catastrophic fail , obviously this is made on purpose , so the user learns that they need this feature to actually play this mod , instead of right clicking to attack a single unit . This wave its inspired from the first actual push of cavalry that actually did happened in the real battle .

Wave 2 : Its actually a surprise attack , it spawns with wave 1 , but does not attack until wave 1 is completed , your surviving units of wave 1 may surely die trying to survive , but your reinforcements will come in time , just dont forget to attack move when they come to their objective!

Wave 3 : This is one of my favorite waves , its called the push of pikes and its just a battle of pikes v pikes , inspired by the movie ala triste. you will need more than at least 100 soldiers to win.

Wave 4 : This is a bit strange one , it didnt happened in the real battle but its just a projection on the ambush of the arcabuces that did happened but since you dont get arcabuceros until you complete wave 4 , its like re doing history . its basically an spawn of enemy militia in your side of the basement , your reinforcements , cannot come to defend you , until you kill them .

reinforcements of wave 4 : called internally as "flandes reinforcements" its the most heavy reinforcements you can get , you get hand cannoneers and 80 extra spearman 

Wave 5 : this is the hardest one imo , you will need to do shot and pike in this one , and when they charge agaist you , you will need to defnd the hand cannoners in the middle of the pikeman formation , so you can protect them meanwhile your spearman fights against cavalry . enemy siege will also come in , so you will need extra help from spearmans to kill enemy siege meanwhile cavalry is attacking your main formation .

Wave 6 : Spawns with wave 7 as well , but wave 6 consists on enemy cavalry on your side of the basement charging agaisnt you from behind , and the main enemy formation charged with cavalry and hand cannoners from the front .

Wave 7 : Its just the same as wave 6 but instead of attacking you , they will deffend the hill from you , kill them all and secure your victory .

# About reinforcements 

You will get an number of reinforcements every time you complete a wave , im not going to reveal what those numbers are , you will need to play to find out :)

# About The future..

I have a few updates planned for rocroi already , some are just bug fixes , but others are indeed updates , first of all , i would like to modify rocroi so we could play 2v2 with a friend on a bigger map , bigger plains and bigger battles! 

I would also like to add a more hard version of my mod , seems i actually did spend like more than 30 hours for sure , just debugging my mod and trying strategies to beat it , i may consider my mod as easy (fun fact : it may be impossible to beat rocroi on your first try without knowing anything)

So yeah , a harder rocroi should be possible to make in mere hours . Same thing with an easier rocroi .
