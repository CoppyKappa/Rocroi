# About the mod..

Rocroi battle is a pve mod , that introduces pike and shot strategy into a real viable thing in the game . Your role its to defend your place and wait until the enemy regiments are left over with just the posibility of defending the besiege of the city . 

You will start with a regiment of the tercio viejo , the first try of the french to take your basement will be in vain , or at least it should . It depends to you on how you manage to survive the first regiment .

If you win , your units will automatically come back to their spot and you will be rewarded with some reinforcements , here is when the math comes with an importance , because the number of reinforcements its not re-ajusted depending on your current alive troops . So you cannot waste ANY of the potential you have with your current units.

If you loose , you will fail to recieve the reinforcements and you will simply loose the game . 

You will notice that the change of difficulty its actually linear and with each wave you win , it gets harder and the AI tries new strategies , wave 5 its the most serious one , and in this one you will surely have to use pike and shot strat to survive . After wave 6 and 7 will also become a challenge and you may not survive in your first attempts .

The battle Of Rocroi Mod takes usually 20 or 30 minutes to complete , but if you use some **tricks** , maybe you can round that number to 10 minutes or so. 

As a spaniard on my own i want to say that im not against france or nothing like that , i did actually made this mod in memorial of our ancestors. The objective is to beat french , but only because french have already won the war . If spain originally won the war , the objective would change to defeat the spanish . So dont feel attacked. 

# About history ..

The battle of Rocroi was a real thing , where real people died on it . The battle of rocroi started on 1643 , the 30 years war just started and france was informed that two tercios were commanded to destroy and conquer Rocroi . In command of the spaish tercios we had Francisco de Melo and in the french regiment we had Luis II de Borbón-Condé , properly known as the Duque of Enghien . 

Spain originally lost this war , and this was known as the point when spain started to loose its empire and its hegemony on europe.

France did win this war , according to wikipedia they did win because they were informed that spanish reinforcements were coming , so they did a surprise attack. 

The first two cavalry attacks were horrible for france , and enghien barely survived . But then they saw a posibility and they desintegrated the arcabuceros formation leading to a catastrophic tercio dissolvement . After seeing this loss , the italian and german tercios surrendered and only spanish tercios were left on the battle , they resisted 3 more cavalry attacks and then they won a push of pike (pikeman vs pikeman battle) 

After all , they lost due to the loss of reinforcements and because spanish cannons were out of munition , as well as one of the regiments of the tercio of arcabuces was dissolved.

They were actually offered an honored surrender . But spanish tercios did reply with "his execellency seems to forget that he is facing an spanish tercio" .
